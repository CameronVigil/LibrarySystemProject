  "description": "This project is to expand on my previously made project, Library System. I initially coded that one\r in C++ to demonstrate my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming. I have been interested in\r learning how to make a web application, so I have been trying to turn my previously made project\r into a full stack web app. I started by converting the code into Python, to practice OOP in PYthon\r and in hopes make my end goal easier to achieve. I have researched how to implement a database\r for an Object-Oriented program, and I have decided on an Object Relational Mapping design, using\r SQLAlchemy. Now that I have a very simple database set up for the library book items, I am now\r attempting to add a frontend to the project with Vue.js.",

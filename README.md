# LibrarySystemProject

This project is to expand on my previously made project, Library System. I initially coded that one
in C++ to demonstrate my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming. I have been interested in
learning how to make a web application, so I have been trying to turn my previously made project
into a full stack web app. I started by converting the code into Python, to practice OOP in PYthon
and in hopes make my end goal easier to achieve. I have researched how to implement a database
for an Object-Oriented program, and I have decided on an Object Relational Mapping design, using
SQLAlchemy. Now that I have a very simple database set up for the library book items, I am now
attempting to add a frontend to the project with Vue.js.

After trying to figure out how to create a frontend using Vue.js and Python, I have figure out what
I will now be doing to try to make that happen. I am now implement a simple Vue interface and will
retrieve data from the SQLite database using PHP. First time using PHP, we'll see how this all goes.
If I can get that all figured out, I will then start adding mock cases, where a bunch of customers,
books, and transactions will occur, and I can use my new interface to display data.
